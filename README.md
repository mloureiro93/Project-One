# Project-One

This project was mainly inspired by my time spent in South Korea and it revolves around korean drinking culture.

Aesthetically wise I was inspired by the bright, colouful and busy korean night-time streets.

The game is set at a work dinner. In Korea these are feared by most employees since, due to said drinking culture, you cannot refuse a drink from anyone older than you or from a work superior.

The falling objects featured in my game correspond to the most consumed alcoholic drinks in korea, beer and soju (a type of licor with a rather high alcohol content). As well as a type of korean soup called 'Hangover Soup' which is meant to help you recover after a long night of drinking.

This game was built using html, css, javasricp and canvas as part of the first one week project of Ironhack Boothcamp.

Here's the link to the game demo:
